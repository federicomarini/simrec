## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Changed http --> https, adding the trailing slashes; the links are correct, as 
there is a simple redirect from this shorter and compact format
* Added a reference to the method in the Description: field, using the <doi:...> format 

## Test environments

* local R installation, R 4.0.3
* Mac OS 10.15.7 (on GitHub Actions), R 4.0.3
* ubuntu 18.04.5 (on GitHub Actions), R 4.0.3
* Windows Server 2019 10.0.17763 (on GitHub Actions), R 4.0.3
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
